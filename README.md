Source code for the numerical experiments conducted in the thesis "Toward Interpretable Quantum Machine Learning: Feature Attribution and Variational Quantum Circuits"

`FeatureAttr.py` serves as a head file containing repeatedly used feature attribution algorithms and helper function.

`synthetic_4x4.ipynb` demonstrates how to use feature attribution methods to explain an explicit model VQC with a 4$\times$4 synthetic image dataset.

`FashionMNIST.ipynb` demonstrates the explanation of a single-qubit data-reuploading classifier with a downscaled 9$\times$9 FashionMNIST binary classification task.
