This repository contains the source code for the numerical experiments conducted in the master's thesis titled "Toward Interpretable Quantum Machine Learning: Feature Attribution and Variational Quantum Circuits".

The `FeatureAttr.py` script acts as the core module, which includes various feature attribution algorithms and helper functions that are repeatedly used throughout the different experiments.

The `synthetic_4x4.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the usage of feature attribution methods to interpret a VQC model that has been trained on a $`4\times4`$ synthetic image dataset.

The `FashionMNIST.ipynb` notebook provides an example of how to explain a single-qubit data-reuploading classifier that was utilized in a $`9\times9`$ downscaled FashionMNIST binary classification task.
